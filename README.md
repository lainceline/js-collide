# Particle Collision Simulator

This project is a particle collision simulator that visualizes the motion and collisions of particles in a confined space. The particles change color based on their speed, creating a heat map effect. The average speed of the particles is also plotted over time using a real-time chart.

## Features

- Real-time particle simulation with collisions.
- Heat map effect: particle colors reflect their speed.
- Adjustable number of particles and particle size using sliders.
- Real-time chart displaying the average speed of particles over time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lainceline/js-collide.git
    cd js-collide
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the simulation.

## Usage

- Use the sliders to adjust the number of particles and their size.
- The simulation will update in real-time based on the slider values.
- Observe the particles colliding and changing color based on their speed.
- The average speed of the particles is displayed on a chart below the simulation.
